The language I created is used for basic arithmetic of Power series. It can take derivates,
apply functional composition, integrate and do arithmetic.

The main challenges of this project were making the language a polymorphic EDSL and understanding how classes and instances work. Besides
that the main difficulty of the project was all of the power series math to make different operations work.
The project may look short but took a good long time.
