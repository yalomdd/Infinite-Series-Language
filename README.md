Developed Language to compute arithmetic, functional composition, and integration of power series.
The language I created is used for basic arithmetic of Power series. It can take derivates,
apply functional composition, integrate and do arithmetic.

The main challenges of this project were making the language a polymorphic EDSL and understanding how classes and instances work. 
Besides that the main difficulty of the project was all of the power series math to make different operations work.
